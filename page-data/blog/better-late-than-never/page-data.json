The main motivation was to learn new things. So I've created a list of technologies I wanted to build my blog with:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 488px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/935a8bf06e43d3f9dd8704daef188435/117e9/blog-tech-stack.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 150%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/935a8bf06e43d3f9dd8704daef188435/cc182/blog-tech-stack.webp 148w,\n/static/935a8bf06e43d3f9dd8704daef188435/f7e40/blog-tech-stack.webp 295w,\n/static/935a8bf06e43d3f9dd8704daef188435/e519b/blog-tech-stack.webp 488w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/935a8bf06e43d3f9dd8704daef188435/8ee9c/blog-tech-stack.jpg 148w,\n/static/935a8bf06e43d3f9dd8704daef188435/ebbe7/blog-tech-stack.jpg 295w,\n/static/935a8bf06e43d3f9dd8704daef188435/117e9/blog-tech-stack.jpg 488w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/935a8bf06e43d3f9dd8704daef188435/117e9/blog-tech-stack.jpg\"\n          alt=\"List of technologies\"\n          title=\"Technologies\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>At that moment I haven't worked with either of them (except MySQL I guess) and hardly understood how I could wire them all together. Also you might noticed that I didn't write a word about infrastructure and deployment of my future site (I had no idea about it).</p>\n<p>Time went on, I got a job, started to get familiar with technologies from my list: we actively used Liquibase on my first project; I figured out that I can use fancy groovy and gradle instead of xml and maven to write build scripts; but the main frontend library was jQuery, and it was clear that I wouldn't like to use it in personal project. In a year I joined project with AngularJS, one more year later I had realized that I would not use either :-)</p>\n<h2>Getting closer to right stack</h2>\n<p>Meanwhile react was getting more and more popular. And I decided to give it a try: colleagues of mine and I started local frontend community - WebPurple and to be true frontend community it must have its own site. Its first version has under the hood: react, redux,material-ui, koa, mongoose and was deployed to some VPS. I've learned a couple of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Material Design fits tools best (not sites)</li>\n<li>managing content manually is bad idea</li>\n<li>IaaS is overkill (also painful) as well as PaaS (after a couple of months fighting with manual setup of all infrastructure to VM I've moved to heroku and mlab) for promo site</li>\n<li>I don't want to pay for hosting (or a at least it to be cheap)</li>\n<li>I want WebPurple site to be BLAZING fast (without much effort)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Love at second sight</h2>\n<p>Any ideas on what I am gonna talking about? Static site generation, JAMStack, GastbyJS! In early 2018, I began to hear more and more about Gatsby. I don't know why didn't pay much attention to it when I first time heard about it (I might thought it is not applicable for my cases). But after I started to investigate the approach (JAMStack) it offers I had fallen in love üòç. It took me about 2 weeks to migrate the whole (thought it is not that big) site from koa, mongodb and heroku to gatsby, netlify-cms and netlify.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>‚ö°Ô∏èsite had perfect performance by default</p>\n<ul>\n<li>static markup (first load)</li>\n<li>code splitting</li>\n<li>image optimization</li>\n<li>prefetch...</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üíÉcontent is easily managed via CMS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>user friendly UI</li>\n<li>extensible (build on react)</li>\n<li>content stored alongside your code (in git repo!)...</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>üôàinfrastructure is the simplest (ADN aka better CDN)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CD - deploy on every git push</li>\n<li>automatic PR preview</li>\n<li>https, custom domains, AWS lambdas...</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can checkout the result - www.webpurple.net (source). I've even given a talk (russian) about it.</p>\n<p>Later I've applied gatsby for one of my customers news site, but with a bit different setup: strapi as a CMS and Jenkins as a CD tool.</p>\n<h2>Happy end</h2>\n<p>Finally I felt like I've found best toolchain and it was time to get my hands on personal site. Since I fill pretty comfortable with technical stack (although this time I use contentful as CMS, travis as CI/CD and github pages as a hosting), my motivation is less about learning new things and more about improving my english (via writing articles about amazing things I deal with) and a bit of showing off ü§ì. I hope you enjoy the site (its unique design üòá). And you started to think about building your one (using great gatsby of course). Keep in mind that gatsby is suitable not only for blogs or promo-sites, it can make any of your sites performant (even for e-commerce project).</p>\n<h3>P.S.</h3>\n<p>By the way I've started to develop my site before it had become mainstream üòÇ.</p>"},"similarPosts":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"dynamics-in-a-static-site","title":"Dynamics in a static site","date":"2019-01-28T22:38:57.492Z","tags":["cloud-functions","gcp","github-api","reach-ui","reactjs","CORS","JAMStack"]},"timeToRead":4}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"load-everything-lazily-with-intersectionobserver","title":"Load everything lazily with IntersectionObserver","date":"2019-01-23T21:52:08.746Z","tags":["reactjs","react-hooks","web-api"]},"timeToRead":1}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"slug":"the-simplest-example-of-scheduling-on-the-main-thread","title":"The simplest example of scheduling on the main thread","date":"2019-02-19T22:42:04.602Z","tags":["web-api","algorithms","reactjs"]},"timeToRead":4}}]},"site":{"meta":{"siteUrl":"https://www.nikitakirsanov.com"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"8eb81e46-fb1a-55c2-855b-3d507cacad4b","similarPosts":["dae1d080-147c-533f-86c6-0dd09a4e3b81","2c5e8ce3-f665-5c2a-b195-32e5596693e7","e7cf91c9-ffaa-57c9-8425-241aba5424c2"]}}}
