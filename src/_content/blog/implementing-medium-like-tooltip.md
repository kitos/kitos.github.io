preface: >-
  Do you know that if you select post text on medium a tooltip with several
  options (tweet, highlight...) will appear? Have you used it? I would like to
  tell you how to create similar one and about DOM API I've learned during
  implementation.

  - render-props

It might (and should) look like quite a trivial thing to implement. But still there are some pitfalls, so I want to tell how to avoid them, what libraries and patterns can help. And again to strengthen my English üòÅ

## Positioning is not easy

Here is a list of problems commonly faced when dealing with popups:

* how to position element over everything else aka _z-index: 999;_
* take into account viewport borders
* handle scrolling

Fortunately we live in open source era, so there is plenty of ready solutions. E.g. [react-popper](https://github.com/FezVrasta/react-popper) - library that takes care about all positioning issues. I've already used it in my previous projects and was satisfied. So I'll use it here as well.

Let's try to create simple popup using it:

[popper-example](https://codesandbox.io/embed/2m4r4r96j?autoresize=1&hidenavigation=1&view=preview)

By the way, its api should be more neat [with hooks](https://github.com/FezVrasta/react-popper/issues/241).
