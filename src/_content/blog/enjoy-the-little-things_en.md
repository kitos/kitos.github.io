Well, looks like now, during self isolation caused by COVID-19 🦠, I'll have some time to code and maybe even to write a couple of articles about it (code). This one is the first one, in it I'm gonna play with `react-spring` to create simple digital clock animation like this:

## Small things matter

How did I come up with this idea? I was just bored, started to check my pet projects, settled on [my game of life](https://kitos.github.io/game-of-life/), considered its UI to be uneventful and decided that it might be good idea to add some emojis, cause everybody like them 😋!

Implementation of this small component doesn't sound like a rocket science, but I will do my best to touch some interesting topics here, and after all I enjoined the process. And it is actually funny to realise that after more than 6 years of coding, participating in pretty complex projects and trying different technologies I still can take pleasure in things event smaller than this clock. I hope everyone can find a field where they can do it as well.

## First building block

Lets start with something really simple lets build a component which can render a numeral using emojis - 4️⃣2️⃣:

```jsx
let emojiDigits = ["0️⃣", "1️⃣", "2️⃣", "3️⃣", "4️⃣", "5️⃣", "6️⃣", "7️⃣", "8️⃣", "9️⃣"];

let EmojiNumber = ({ value }) => (
  <div>
    {value
      .toString()
      .split("")
      .map((n, i) => (
        <span key={i}>{emojiDigits[n]}</span>
      ))}
  </div>
);
```

Nothing special except maybe they *key*: most of the time we [use some *id* as *key*](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) and [trying to avoid using index](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318) cause it kinda kills the idea - react won't be able to optimize DOM update, e.g. by moving element instead of deletition and constructing new one in another place. But in our example order/index is the only thing that matters - the order of digits in numbers is important, isn't it?

Having this small component we can already render current time:

```jsx
let Time = ({ value }) => (
  <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
    <EmojiNumber value={value.getHours()} />
    :
    <EmojiNumber value={value.getMinutes()} />
    :
    <EmojiNumber value={value.getSeconds()} />
    :
    <EmojiNumber value={value.getMilliseconds()} />
  </div>
)
```

Easy, but the implementation has a bug 🐛, did you notice it?

For time \`03:05:09\` it will render 3️⃣: 5️⃣: 9️⃣ while I would expect 0️⃣3️⃣: 0️⃣5️⃣: 0️⃣9️⃣ . Let's fix it with `padTime` *function*:

```jsx
// highlight-next-line
let padTime = (t, l = 2) => t.toString().padStart(l, '0')

let Time = ({ value }) => (
  <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
    // highlight-next-line
    <EmojiNumber value={padTime(value.getHours())} />
    :
    // highlight-next-line
    <EmojiNumber value={padTime(value.getMinutes())} />
    :
    // highlight-next-line
    <EmojiNumber value={padTime(value.getSeconds())} />
  </div>
)
```
