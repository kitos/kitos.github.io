  Well, looks like now, with all this self isolation caused by COVID-19, I'll
  have some time to code and maybe even to write a couple of articles about it.
  This one will be the first one. In it I'm gonna play with react-spring to
  create simple digital clock animation.

Well, looks like now, during self isolation caused by COVID-19 ðŸ¦ , I'll have some time to code and maybe even to write a couple of articles about it (code). This one is the first one, in it I'm gonna play with `react-spring` to create simple digital clock animation like this:

## Idea

How did I come up with this idea? Probably I was just bored, started to check my pet projects, settled on [my game of life](https://kitos.github.io/game-of-life/), considered its UI to be uneventful and decided that it might be good idea to add some emojis, cause everybody like them ðŸ˜‹!

## Small things matter

Implementation of this small component doesn't sound like a rocket science, but I will do my best to touch some interesting topics here, and after all I enjoined the process. And it is actually funny to realise that after more than 6 years of coding, participating in pretty complex projects and trying different technologies I still can take pleasure in things event smaller than this clock. I hope everyone can find a field where they can do it as well.
