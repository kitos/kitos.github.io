It is hard to underestimate an importance  of [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) transformation tools in the frontend now:

* we use `babel`

  * to transform the most recent *ECMAScript* versions to work with older versions of browsers
  * to [optimize our code](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/babel-react-optimize)
  * to get [new features](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop)
* we use `eslint` to enforce best practices or avoid mistakes/bugs
* we use `prettier` to format the code

But today I wanna tell a short story about using *AST* transformation to refactor the code. Like some codemodes you might used.

## Backstory

At [tourlane](https://www.tourlane.de/) we use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) (probably, the most popular *CSS-IN-JS* solutions in react) along with [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) (awesome utility belt for easily writing responsive styles based on scales from global theme), so we can write something like this:

```jsx

```

While some of you might find this style of writing components pretty controversial, this is not the point of this article. But I still can recommend these articles to [](https://jxnblk.com/blog/two-steps-forward/)get more reasoning behind it:

* [Two steps forward, one step back](https://jxnblk.com/blog/two-steps-forward/)
* [Styles and Naming](<* [https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/styles-and-naming](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/styles-and-naming/)/>)
* [Old and new ideas in React UI](https://react-ui.dev/core-concepts/ideas)

So the point of the code block from above is the usage of responsive CSS values: `something` (pretty handy isn't it?). Under the hood it will use media breakpoints provided in [theme](https://styled-system.com/theme-specification) to compile responsive styles like:

```

```

## The problem

When we started one of our projects we didn't have any styles specific to tablets, let's say we had something similar to this:

```jsx
let breakpoints = [
  // again no need to define lower breakpoint
  // since we use mobile-first
  // (styles applied without media are concidered to be mobile)
  
  '64em', // desktop
  '80em', // wide
]

let Layout = ({ children }) => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={{ breakpoints }}>
    <Header />
    {children}
    <Footer />
  </ThemeProvider>
)
```

But lately we got new page where mobile and table designs are quite different. But our scale system doesn't support it ðŸ˜§: we cannot use responsive attributes we get used to ðŸ˜¨. If we just add one more breakpoint, it'll break all existing components ðŸ˜°.

I bet you've been in a situation like this. E.g. you might used some library api which was deprecated. Luckily in cases like this, library authors usually prepare codemods which will update your codebase for you. So you don't even have to understand what it does under the hood.

But in our case there was no one to rely on, nobody to blame... but... me? ðŸ¥º

## jscodeshift to the rescue

Even though we could write tablet specific styles *by hand* - using *normal* `styled-component`s syntax. It wasn't the way we wanted to proceed - we really like the api provided by `styled-system`, moreover we didn't want to introduce  ambiguity in writing responsive styles. And obviously we wasn't keen to go through the whole codebase to change all usages of responsive props.

Sounds like a perfect task for codemode!

I have never worked with them, but I've heard that [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) is a cool tool to build them, e.g. react team [use it.](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod) 

All you have to do is create `js` (`typescript` is also supported) file and export *transform* function which will take care of required AST transformations.

```typescript
import { Transform } from 'jscodeshift';

const directions = ['', 't', 'r', 'b', 'l', 'x', 'y'];
const spaceAttributes = [
  ...directions.map(d => `m${d}`),
  ...directions.map(d => `p${d}`),
];

const transform: Transform = (fileInfo, { j }) =>
  j(fileInfo.source)
    .find(j.JSXAttribute)
    .forEach(({ node }) => {
      const attributeName =
        typeof node.name.name === 'string' ? node.name.name : `Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`;
      const { value } = node;

      if (
        spaceAttributes.includes(attributeName) &&
        // we are interested only array expressions which has more then 1 value
        // like <Box m={[8, 16, 24]}>
        value?.type === 'JSXExpressionContainer' &&
        value.expression.type === 'ArrayExpression' &&
        value.expression.elements.length > 1
      ) {
        const [xs, ...otherMedias] = value.expression.elements;

        value.expression.elements = [xs, j.identifier('null'), ...otherMedias];
      }
    })
    .toSource();

export default transform;
```
