## Where is it coming from?

First of all, technically [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason_(programming_language)) is not even a language. It is a new syntax for [ocaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml) - battle-tested language.

`Reason` is usually mentioned in `javascript` and `reactjs` context.
